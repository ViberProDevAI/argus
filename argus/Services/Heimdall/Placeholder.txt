// This file is intended to REPLACE parts of HeimdallOrchestrator to fix the registration.
// However, since we are building a new "Data Gateway", maybe we should put logic there?
// The user prompt said: "3.4 ProviderCapabilityRegistry / Adapter Registry Fix ... Update planRequest".
// So I must fix HeimdallOrchestrator directly.

// Strategy: I will read HeimdallOrchestrator first to apply patches safely.
